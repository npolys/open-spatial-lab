// Deliberately a CLASSIC (non-module) script, loaded via a plain <script src> — NOT importable
// as an ES module. It must run synchronously during the browser's initial HTML parse and use
// document.write() so its output becomes part of the same parse stream as genuinely-static
// markup. This is not a style choice: confirmed empirically (see the x3dom-spikes/ investigation
// this session) that X3DOM's <Inline> node only reliably completes its first load when it exists
// in that initial parse stream — a node built via document.createElement()/appendChild() at any
// point after page load, in any ordering, never loads. A node that DID complete that first load
// can then have its `url` attribute reassigned freely and will reliably reload with new content.
//
// So every pool slot is seeded with a placeholder glTF (giving it that one required real load),
// and x3dom-render-adapter.mjs's createInlineAsset() claims a free slot and swaps its url to the
// real target instead of creating a node from scratch.
//
// Fixed at 32 for now — WoWAPI-side content packing (bundling multiple hosted items into fewer
// served files) is expected to keep concurrent-Inline-node demand well under this, so a
// host-capability-scaled pool isn't needed yet.

        // full-size, un-scaled copy of the placeholder asset, visible in the main scene ("lots of
        // crowns being drawn" — a live-QA report, since the placeholder happens to be
        // equip-crown.glb). createInlineAsset() only sets render="true" back once the claimed
        // slot's url has actually swapped to the caller's real target content (NOT immediately on
        // claim — an earlier version did that and re-introduced the same visible-crown symptom for
        // the whole swap-and-load window, which became multi-second-visible once WoW-negotiated
        // asset fetches started claiming slots); disposeNode() sets it back to "false" on release,
        // alongside the existing url reset.
